## 步驟

### Discovering strengths: 
__回顧前次成功背後的原因。著重在 <span style={{color: '#0044FF'}}>特性</span> 與 <span style={{color: '#0044FF'}}>價值</span>__ 。
* 那些事做得比預期好，讓Team，客戶，自己得到利益。
    * 如何成功的? 我們做了哪些?
    * How did we do it? What did we do to make it successful?
    * 那些技巧是有幫助的? 那些經驗與特質讓你擁有這些技巧?
    * What helped us do it? Which expertise or skills made the difference? Which strengths that you possess made it possible?
    * 要如何讓團隊也能擁有相同的特質?
    * How did being part of a team help to realize it? What did team members do to help you? Which strengths does your team have?
* 讚揚式的詢問(four key questions)
    * 那些是做得不錯? 沒討論會遺忘的是?
    * What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
    * 學了甚麼?
    * What did we learn?
    * 下次我們應該可以試試...?
    * What should we do differently next time?
    * 那些事還在困擾我們?
    * What still puzzles us?

### Defining actions: 前次遇到的問題，下次是否可能再次影響到大家?
* 可以改問:
    * How can you use your individual or team strengths to solve this problem?
    * What would you do more frequently that would help prevent the problem from happening again?
    * Which actions can you take, which you are already capable of?
